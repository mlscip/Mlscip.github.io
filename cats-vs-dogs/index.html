      <h1> Dogs Have Better Noses </h1>
        <p>Dogs can discriminate odors at concentrations nearly 100 million times lower 
           than humans can. The wet nose is essential for determining the direction of 
           the air current containing the smell. Cold receptors in the skin are sensitive 
           to the cooling of the skin by evaporation of the moisture by air currents.</p>

      <h1>Cats Have Better Tongues</h1>
        <p>Cats are known for their cleanliness, spending many hours licking their coats. 
           The cat's tongue has backwards-facing spines about 500 micrometers long, which 
           are called papillae. These are quite rigid, as they contain keratin. These 
           spines allow cats to groom themselves by licking their fur, with the rows of 
           papillae acting like a hairbrush.</p>
